Fillit.
Description:
Fillit is a Tetris solver algorithm that, for a given input made of Tetris pieces, it will arrange them into the smallest square space.

Usage:
First of all, the project must be built.
It can be built, by executing the Makefile using the "make" command.
The project can be tested with the test files that can be found in "exemple" directory with the following usage:
(for example) ./fillit exemple/1.fillit

For a personalized test, the test file must be written in the same way as the test files from the "exemple" directory:
 - 4 collomn wide followed by a new line, each line;
 - 4 lines per piece;
 - each pieces must be separated by a SINGLE new line;
 - the file must end with the last piece. Any new line or other character is forbidden.
 - the piece must be described only by '.' and '#' characters. Any other character is also forbidden.
Good luck!
